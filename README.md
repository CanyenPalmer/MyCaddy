**My Caddy** is an intuitive and customizable golf shot calculator designed for golfers of all skill levels — from beginners seeking club confidence to seasoned pros refining precision under varying conditions.

## 📐 What It Does

This Python desktop app uses physics-based modeling to help golfers estimate the *true effective distance* of a shot by accounting for:

- **Lie Condition** (e.g., fairway, rough, buried)
- **Temperature** (°F)
- **Weather** (sun, rain, snow, etc.)
- **Wind Direction & Speed**
- **Shot Direction**
- **Flyer Lie effect** (optional unpredictable shot gain)

The app adjusts carry distance dynamically to reflect real-world playing factors, giving users a more accurate and trustworthy number to work with on the course.
